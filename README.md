# Defect_Similarity_Analysis
To find similar defects based on Ticket description wordings [NLP]

Mostly at legacy applications, the defect counts are so huge that they get repetative and duplicates
A phenomenal time is spent if a ticket is reworked on if a solution already exists for a past similar ticket that was resolved.
So here explaining a way to find similar defects from a list using NLP and cosine_similarity

I cannot make the data public as it was created for POC for one of my assignment. Just sharing the concept behind it and the code snipped used. 
The file contains 
a. cosinie similarity explanation,
b. small POC for finding similarity between three statments and 
c. Actual code to build defect analysis tool
